# Initial-Data-Transformation-Script
This commit introduces a new Python script, 'data_transformer.py', designed to perform initial data cleaning and transformation tasks. The script reads raw data from a specified CSV file, handles missing values, standardizes date formats, and outputs a cleaned CSV file. This is the foundational script for our data processing pipeline.
